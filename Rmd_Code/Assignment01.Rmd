Using heights from the class the survey data. Was not entirely sure which data set to use.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
class_data <- read_csv("/Users/sandeep/Downloads/R\ Code/Heights.csv")
```
```{r}
head(class_data)
```
Head returns the first 6 cases in the data set. Tail is the opposite, returning the last 6 cases in the data set.
