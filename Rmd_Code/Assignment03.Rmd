```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```
```{r}
nice <- read_csv("/Users/sandeep/Downloads/R\ Code/nice-ride.csv")
```
```{r}
tail(nice)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=nice, aes(x=duration)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=500, color="black", fill='slategrey') + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,13000,1000)) + labs(x='Duration of rides in seconds') + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(nice$duration),color="yellow")) + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(nice$duration),color="turquoise"))
```
```{r}
mean(nice$duration)
median(nice$duration)
```
The histogram is skewed to the right and is unimodal. The variability is quite high as the vast majority of data points lie within the range of 0-2500 but there are several outliers. Thus the median is a better measure of typical which is bus ride of 841 seconds. We can conclude the majority of trips are 0-40 minutes long while far and few have trips hours long. The largest value is 500 seconds long.

```{r}
ggplot(data=nice, aes(x=duration, fill=start_campus)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=500,color='black', position='identity')+ scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,13000,1000)) + labs(x='Duration of rides in seconds')
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=nice, aes(x=duration, fill=start_campus)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=500,color='black', position='identity') + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,13000,1000)) + labs(x='Duration of rides in seconds')+ facet_wrap(~start_campus, nrow=2)
```
There is a relationship between whether the ride started on campus and the duration. If the ride started on campus, the ride should be expected to be shorter, typically the length of a couple of minutes. If it didn't start on-campus, the rides are longer, 10-15 minutes and even longer. This is even where outliers can be seen of hours long trips.
