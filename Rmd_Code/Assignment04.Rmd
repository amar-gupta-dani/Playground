```{r}

```
```{r}
ggplot(data=nice, aes(x=start_month)) + geom_bar()
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=nice, aes(x=start_month, fill=start_campus)) + geom_bar(position='dodge', aes(y=(..count..)/sum(..count..))) + ylim(0,0.2) + labs(x='Month Trip started in', y='Percentage of Rides Started in Month',fill='Start on campus?') + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=30,vjust=0.8,size=10)) + scale_fill_manual(values=c('#D92D02','#3BB300')) + scale_x_discrete(limits=c("april","may","june","july","august","september","october","november"))
```
For the most part, when the number of rides increases, the number of rides which started on campus also increases. There are some exceptions such as in May and September. The only month where rides started on campus exceeded the rides started around the Twin Cities was November. Overall, the number of rides started on campus is usually 1/3 of the total rides across the Twin Cities.
```{r}
ggplot(data=nice, aes(x=start_time, fill=start_campus)) + geom_bar(position='dodge',color='black') + scale_fill_manual(values=c('#D92D02','#3BB300')) + labs(x='Time of Day Ride Started', y='Number of Rides during Time',fill='Start on campus?') + scale_x_discrete(limits=c('morning','afternoon','evening'))
```
Once again, the number of rides started on campus is proportional to the number of rides started across the Twin Cities. This is proportion seems to be 1/3 again. It seems the number of rides in the evening (TC) > morning (TC), however, morning(UofM) > evening(UofM): a minor observation.
